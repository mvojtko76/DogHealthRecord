## Step 1
###**Research how to create an app** 
###Links:

* [Tips making for app](https://www.bytelion.com/7-tips-to-consider-when-making-a-medical-app-from-integration-to-security/)

##Step 2
### Design the blueprint 
* To figure out how I want it to look like 
*  What the code should look like

**Will be adding a little piece to it as I go along**
